        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Eat My Bubbles is a personal swim tracking app designed for simplicity and clarity.
            This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and
            how it is stored.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            The app stores swim session data that you manually enter, such as distance, time,
            and workout details. This data is stored locally on your device and securely synced
            to a private cloud database associated with your account.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
        <p>
            Your workout data is used solely to display your history, statistics, and progress
            within the app. It is not shared with any third parties and is never used for
            advertising, analytics, or profiling.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Your data is stored in two places:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On your device</strong> – for fast access and offline use.</li>
            <li><strong>In a secure cloud database</strong> – to keep your data backed up and available if you reinstall the app or switch devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Only you can access your synced data.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The app may integrate with optional third‑party services such as Samsung Health.
            Any data accessed from these services is used only within the app and is not
            transmitted elsewhere.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>
            You may delete your workout data at any time from within the app. Uninstalling the
            app will remove all locally stored data. You may also delete your cloud‑synced data
            by using the account deletion option within the app.
        </p>
